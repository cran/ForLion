Description: Designing experimental plans that involve both discrete and continuous factors with general parametric statistical models using the 'ForLion' algorithm and 'EW ForLion' algorithm. The algorithms will search for locally optimal designs and EW optimal designs under the D-criterion. Reference: Huang, Y., Li, K., Mandal, A., & Yang, J., (2024)<doi:10.1007/s11222-024-10465-x>.
